### [CAPM](https://github.com/PRANAVKUMAR183/CAPM) (Link to project)

*This regression output shows the relationship between excess stock returns (dependent variable: Rets_ex) and excess market returns (Mkt-RF). The regression uses the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) .

**Key Techniques Used**: CAPM,OLS

**Outcome**: R-squared: 0.607, indicating that 60.7% of the variability in excess stock returns is explained by the market risk premium.

Mkt-RF Coefficient: 1.179, implying a positive relationship between market excess returns and stock excess returns. The t-statistic (50.873) and p-value (0.000) confirm this is statistically significant.

Constant: 0.0383, though not statistically significant (p-value = 0.200).

Durbin-Watson: 1.879, suggesting low autocorrelation in residuals.
